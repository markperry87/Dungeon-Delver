# Dungeon Delver

## Overview
Dungeon Delver is a top-down dungeon rogulike RPG built with Python and Pygame. Players navigate procedurally generated rooms, combat enemies, and collect equipment to enhance their stats. 

The game works, but there are some bugs/UI issues. Also, the stats need a lot of refinement, as does the combat system (which is currently not that fun).

This game was a learning experience for me and the code became pretty disorganized, which made it frustratting to work on. It needs a lot more polish, but I didn't feel like working on it anymore.

## Features
- Procedurally generated (but very simplistic) dungeon rooms with increasing difficulty.
- Enemy stat/movement scaling by room tiers.
- Randomly generated weapons with stat dependent names (this could be implemented a lot better).
- Inventory and equipment management for weapons, and armour.
- Boss battles every 10 rooms, as well as special rewards that provide major stat boosts if certain conditions are met.
- Health fountains for recovery every 10 rooms.
- Player attacks, dashing mechanics, and damage mitigation through armor.

## Controls
- W, A, S, D: Move the player.
- Left Mouse Button: Attack in the direction of the cursor.
- Space: Dash in the last movement direction.
- E: Interact with chests, health fountains, and level gates.
- F: Toggle inventory display. (Hold shift in the inventory screen to delete items.)
- R: Restart the game (on Game Over screen).
